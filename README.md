# The Village App: A Description

Building a social networking app for parents is the vision behind this product.  The idea comes from the old saying that "It takes a village to raise a child," and my wife and I are seeing the truth behind this saying now that we have two kids ages 2yrs, and 11 months. However, I feel as though the quoted saying is very antiquated because, while it is true and relevant to today's day and age--because raising kids hasn't gotten any easier--as people, we don't live in the same dynamics we did in the past. Community dynamics are different. We have a lot of technology that parents didn't have 100, 50, or even 20 years ago. Are we leveraging the techonology, mainly the internet, to help us raise our kids as a 'village' or 'communally'?  My initial answer is: 'No.' There's a lot left to be desired when it comes to the internet connecting parents to communally help in parenting. Thus, that is the impetus for this app.

The Village connects parents, and they can post and ask for help in a parenting matter, such as: "When is a good time to put my 2 yeard old to sleep?" or "What brand of diapers is best for a newborn with sensitive skin?" This social aspect of enlisting other parents to help in topics that arise when raising children is really the 'stretch' goal I would say for this project.

For this initial version I've released functionality for parents to set up their kid as a 'collection' in database speak. I want to then set up functionality to have the user add various data about their child.  The different aspects of data, will be 'documents'. For example, a user with a newborn will have the ability to add data on times they feed the child, and how much was eaten, timestamps for the naps the child takes.  Also, there will be functionality to add documents for baths, activities, day/overnight trips data, and emergency contacts.
